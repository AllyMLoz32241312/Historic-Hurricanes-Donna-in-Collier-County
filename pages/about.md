## About the Collection

This exhibit, "Historic Hurricanes: Donna in Collier County", focuses on Hurricane Donna's impacts in Collier County through the use of local media sources, including photos, news reports, and newspapers. Through the use of mixed media, we can learn in the present time how people handled natural disasters back then, and compare those efforts to the ones used today in Southwest Florida communities and FLorida as a whole. 

The digital display features a selection of items from the Collier County Museum regarding Hurricane Donna's landfall in 1960, and mentions several other storms in the area. Hurricanes are a large part of Floridians' lifestyle and history, so this showcase hopes to connect with local residents who have experienced these devastating disasters firsthand, and also inform those who are not familiar with the environment.
