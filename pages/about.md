## About the Collection

 This exhibit, "Historic Hurricanes: Donna in Collier County", focuses on Hurricane Donna's impacts in Collier County through the use of local media sources, including photos, news reports, and newspapers. Through the use of mixed media, we can learn in the present time how people handled natural disasters back then, and compare those efforts to the ones used today in Southwest Florida communities and FLorida as a whole. 

 The digital display features a selection of items from the Collier County Museum regarding Hurricane Donna's landfall in 1960, and mentions several other storms in the area. Hurricanes are a large part of Floridians' lifestyle and history, so this showcase aims to connect with local residents who have experienced these devastating disasters firsthand and to inform those unfamiliar with the environment.

 After Hurricane Donna hit, the area was significantly affected by floodwaters, as displayed in the image above. People had to resort to kayaking out in the waters to get to their destinations, and many trees and buildings were halfway submerged. The storm had sustained winds of 125 miles per hour, resulting in devastation and destruction of agriculture, infrastructure, and homes. Donna contributed to the deaths of twelve people, both directly and indirectly related to the hurricane.

 Hurricanes are a large part of Florida’s history, and to understand them is to learn from them. While technology has become much better on reporting and tracking these storms, the relief efforts remain strong throughout the years, showcasing citizens' dedication in the Collier County communities. Hurricane Donna is a prime example of how people can come together after a tragedy, and this connection can be found through the use of the media presented within the digital exhibit.
